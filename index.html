  <font color="white">The atmosphere of Earth is the layer of gases, commonly known as air, that surrounds the planet Earth and is retained by Earth's gravity. 
  The atmosphere protects life on Earth by absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), 
  and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation).By volume, dry air contains 78.09% .... .</style><br>

    <header><h1>THE UNIVERSE A WORK OF ART</h1></header><br><br>
            <font color=black><p><h4>Many have questioned; "How did <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe"><em>'The Universe'</em></a> come into being?" 
            Was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang"><em>'The Big Bang'</em></a> of happenstance responible or is there <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design"><em>'Intelligent Design'</em></a> behind its creation and being? 
            This has been the age old question since man can trace his existence and being. 
            It seems when you look up, down or around; there are amazing created wonders that sourround.
            One can't help but consider "An Infinite Being of Infinite Worth and Ability"; 
            then look at the Natural Universe as a Tapestry of Infinte Motion, Capacities and Capabilities. 
            Always dispalying, demonstrating and illustrating itself, always in fine form and fashion.
            Albert Einstein said, <em>"Energy can neither be created or destroyed it can only be changed from one form to another".</em>  
            Surely he must have see and understood something of this to make such a statement. 
            He basically defined 'infinity'. A universe of infinite capabilities and capacities.<br><br>
            Time and again intelligent design comes up against much repudiation. 
            However, we appear to be sourrounded by various measures and levels of intelligent design. 
            Such, that enables life in its existence to continue operating in varying capacities; 
            though not infinite such capacities appear consistent in mimicing the infinite.
            One such group are the Great Artists that sourrounds us.<br><br>
            Man has always been artistic in nature and at his every turn mimics the infinte universe that sourrounds him. 
            From his cave drawing to space travel that allowed him to plant a woven flag on the moon's surface; 
            this demonstrates that he is observing his natural universe and mimicing it to become like it. 
            Sadly, it leaves him in the dust each time. 
            The ends of the known universe is estimated to be billions of light years away; 
            he barely knows the galaxy in which he lives and his mortality is a mere seventy years. 
            Unattainable I presume, yet, undeniable in existence and display.<br><br>
            Another thing to consider is each of the universe's individual element has purpose and fits together in purpose and on purpose; 
            sounds intelligent doesn't it?
            If so; "Who is The Great Artist that created the universe and for what purpose was it created?" 
            Another question immediately comes to mind;"Who creates without purpose?"<br><br>
            When one considers 'water' who creates water or wind or air any element so precise in its existence and being? 
            Of what we know today; a chilling thought of water, wind or air created in a vast expanse all on their own with no other elements to interact. 
            Then again add the element of sand to the element of wind and you get a hot barren waste land where magnificent sandcastles are built, 
            sculptured or appear painted on the landscape. 
            Then torn apart and re-sculptured with the same elements; yet, never the same sculpture is rebuilt for millenniums. 
            Then draw your attention to the Ocean sometime a calm serene place at other times a tempestuous place. 
            One time the surface is calm and the depths tempestuous;other times, they switch their raging and their calm at their will. So it seems!
            There, there are beautiful ceatures inhabiting and abiding regardless of the elements and their switching. 
            They call there home and are content to be and be there. Is there an artist behind all that? If so? A Master Artist indeed!<br><br>
            Then picture added elements of other aspects of life and existence as they begin to interact in the earth, ocean, air or space; 
            man and creatures of every kind living out their existence and being. With all their existing, living and being;
            like an artist mixing colors resulting in a booming explosive expression of bright yellows, reds, 
            greens a plethora of delight and a stimulation of all the senses.
            The Universe in its wake an existence does not address any one class of individual or artist. Likewise, its great expanse and unpredicatability 
            demonstrates time and again through discovery 'a power en masse' that is unknown, wildly explosive; 
            yet, can be 'femininely etehreal'in its delicacy and poise.

            This website is intended to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_of_art"><em>"a work of art"</em></a>. 
            Instead of visiting an art gallery at a museum you visit the <a href="http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/">world wide web</a>. 
            A virtual place in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace"><em>cyberspace</em></a> 
            that rivals any <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/art-gallery"><em>art gallery</em></a>. 
            Which in itself can be defined as a work of art.
            Here works of art from the whole world and the known universe; all at once are on display to the whole world .<br>
            The universe, the world, can essentially be viewed as a work of art for all people of all time.
            The <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=element+definition"><em>elements</em></a> of the universe exist for all; 
            and from time memorial have sustained all of life from birth to dying; 
            till, from "whence they came to thence hence" they shall return, once more to the elements. So, maybe Einstein is right about energy... .
            However, it appears the other artists whether man or nature have a total dependence for their
            <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/existence"><em>existence</em></a> and being on the universe. 
            Their art is derived and copied from the already existing universe.
            Thus the universe and its elements do not depend on its inhabitants to exist; with them, they all appear to be part of the universe's natural existence.
            Whatever has been made, has been made to fit the universe. Therefore, their existence is unsustainable when they are not in the universe. 
            Let us then view a few of these natural canvases and tapestries.<br>
            
            As you visit these pages, they are intended to tell a story.  A story titled "Art The Universe".
